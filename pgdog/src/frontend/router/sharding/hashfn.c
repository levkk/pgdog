/*----------
 * mix -- mix 3 32-bit values reversibly.
 *
 * This is reversible, so any information in (a,b,c) before mix() is
 * still in (a,b,c) after mix().
 *
 * If four pairs of (a,b,c) inputs are run through mix(), or through
 * mix() in reverse, there are at least 32 bits of the output that
 * are sometimes the same for one pair and different for another pair.
 * This was tested for:
 * * pairs that differed by one bit, by two bits, in any combination
 *	 of top bits of (a,b,c), or in any combination of bottom bits of
 *	 (a,b,c).
 * * "differ" is defined as +, -, ^, or ~^.  For + and -, I transformed
 *	 the output delta to a Gray code (a^(a>>1)) so a string of 1's (as
 *	 is commonly produced by subtraction) look like a single 1-bit
 *	 difference.
 * * the base values were pseudorandom, all zero but one bit set, or
 *	 all zero plus a counter that starts at zero.
 *
 * This does not achieve avalanche.  There are input bits of (a,b,c)
 * that fail to affect some output bits of (a,b,c), especially of a.  The
 * most thoroughly mixed value is c, but it doesn't really even achieve
 * avalanche in c.
 *
 * This allows some parallelism.  Read-after-writes are good at doubling
 * the number of bits affected, so the goal of mixing pulls in the opposite
 * direction from the goal of parallelism.  I did what I could.  Rotates
 * seem to cost as much as shifts on every machine I could lay my hands on,
 * and rotates are much kinder to the top and bottom bits, so I used rotates.

 *
 * The use of separate functions for mix() and final() allow for a
 * substantial performance increase since final() does not need to
 * do well in reverse, but is does need to affect all output bits.
 * mix(), on the other hand, does not need to affect all output
 * bits (affecting 32 bits is enough).  The original hash function had
 * a single mixing operation that had to satisfy both sets of requirements
 * and was slower as a result.
